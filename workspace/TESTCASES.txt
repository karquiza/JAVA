Automated Test Cases:
1. Check that Reset button clears input fields
2. Check that valid user and password can log-in sucessfully
3. Check that user page displays the correct user name **** NOTE: This test case is intentionally failed in current tester)
4. Check successful "logout" of user from user page
5. Check that invalid user and invalid password results in login error page
6. Check that we can return to login page from error page
7. Check that valid user and invalid password results in login error page

Can be automated (but not yet):
1. Check web elements of each page, including attributes (ex. Enabled, Displayed)

Manual Test Cases:
1. Checking of error case when Login cannot connect to the DB.
--- May be possible to automate using external tools 
(e.g. Jenkins job can setup the required preconditions and additional test suites can be added).
